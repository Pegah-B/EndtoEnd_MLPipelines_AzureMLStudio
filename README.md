# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipelines with Azure Machine Learning Studio

## Overview

This repository contains three ML projects, including Automobile Price Prediction (Regression), Diabetes Prediction (Classification), and Penguin Clustering (Clustering). They demonstrate the development of an end-to-end pipeline using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio with no coding required, all built, deployed, and tested within Azure's user-friendly interface. Detailed documentation for each project is available in its respective PDF file, including:

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - **Azure Workspace and Compute Setup:** Configured the Azure ML workspace and allocated compute resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - **Pipeline Development:** Built and evaluated a regression model using Azure's drag-and-drop interface.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - **Inference Pipeline:** Created an inference pipeline for real-time price predictions.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - **Deployment:** Deployed the predictive service to an Azure Container Instance.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 - **Testing:** Verified the model's accuracy by testing predictions based on automobile characteristics.

The datasets used in these projects are available in this repository. The Automobile Price Data (Raw), used for regression, is provided as a sample dataset in Azure Machine Learning Designer. The Diabetes Data, used for classification, was downloaded from [link](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/microsoft/MLOps/master/examples/AzureML-Primers/data/diabetes.csv) , while the Penguin Data, used for clustering, was downloaded from [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/master/data/penguins.csv).
